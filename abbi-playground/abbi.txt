APPLE VISION PRO vs META QUEST 3
virtual reality is like living in a video game, except you can't pause to go pee.
APPLE VISION PRO: the apple vision pro is just a sleek sophisticated heavy white box which is more detail oriented than its functionality. It is basically a VR headset which costs more than your 2 years clg fee 3L. As it is the first version, it has a limited library of games and applications. With no prior VR background, it is clearn that apple has launched this product to secure their user cedibility
While coming to the third useful invention of GenZ life META QUEST 3: as we all know it is the champion of affordability and a device which lets a dragon inside your room while your mom wonders why u are flailing around the living room. The reason why it is the best is it has an established ecosystem and well-developed infrastructure. Meta has actually delved into the world of VR in 2017 with a fund of more than $2.7bn. Though it does not meet the high end level developer experience it gives a prioritizing cutting edge graphics and processing power. 
In my point of view by thinking about various aspects like budget, content, specs and ecosystem, i consider meta quest 3 is the best option to buy.
